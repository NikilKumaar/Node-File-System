# NODEJS FILE SYSTEM 

- This application creates a web server on port 5000 with two endpoints. The '/createFile' generates a text file in a folder named 'Current_TimeStamp' containing the current timestamp and sends its content as a response. The '/getFiles' endpoint retrieves and returns a list of all text files in the same folder.
